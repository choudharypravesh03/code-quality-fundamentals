# Code Quality Fundamentals

This is a Node.js and Express website that accepts and lists restaurant reservations. You will be able to learn a lot about the latest coding standards and practices that should be used in a web application. Hope it can be of any help to people working on their own applications :)

The backend contains intentional mistakes, like weak validation on email addresses. Inconsistencies in coding style are also intentional.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server runs on port 3000.

There are three routes:

- http://localhost:3000/ - homepage
- http://localhost:3000/reservations - submit a reservation booking request
- http://localhost:3000/admin - view all booking requests; basic auth login/password `admin`

The server persists using a SQLite3 database named `database.sqlite` in the site root.
